Task 1:
Write the method find_max, which takes two integer parameters and returns the larger one.
If they are equal, return which ever.

def find_max(a, b):

Task 2:
One of the differences between Python and other programming languages is that it can return
multiple values in a function (even with different types).
In this task, you will write a function called sum_and_prod(), which takes two integer parameters
and return the sum and product of the two.
(Remember, the return values are ordered, so you need to return the sum first and the product second).
